Hey there! I'm Tejmul Movin, a student currently navigating the exciting landscape of Newton School of Technology. My world revolves around lines of code, algorithms, and the endless possibilities of the digital realm. Recently, I took the plunge into the coding universe and proudly presented my inaugural portfolio project, crafted with the magic of HTML. It's just the beginning, but it feels like the start of something incredible.

Beyond the coding adventures, there's more to me than just syntax and semicolons. I find my escape in the immersive worlds of books, devouring novels that transport me to different realms and challenge my perspective. When I'm not lost in the literary cosmos, you'll likely find me on the football field, where I trade my keyboard for cleats. There's an undeniable thrill in the beautiful game that keeps me coming back for more.

In the quieter moments, I turn to TED Talks, soaking in the wisdom of diverse speakers and exploring a vast array of topics. It's my way of keeping the curiosity alive and continuously learning from the experiences and insights of others. And, of course, I have a soft spot for movies. Whether it's a gripping narrative or a cinematic masterpiece, I appreciate the art of storytelling on the big screen.

As I navigate the challenges of academia and coding intricacies, these hobbies serve as my anchors, providing balance and a touch of joy to my journey. With my goal towards portfolio projects proudly displayed and a passion for technology burning bright, I'm ready to carve out my space in this dynamic world. Here's to the coding adventures and the diverse passions that make me who I am!
